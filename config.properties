# BLE Browser-Android Bridge Configuration
# ========================================
# This file contains shared configuration settings for all components
# (Android app, web client, Python debug tools)

# Message prefix to identify app-specific BLE advertisements
# This prefix is automatically added to all outgoing messages and
# used to filter incoming messages from other BLE devices
# IMPORTANT: If you change this, also update MESSAGE_PREFIX in MainActivity.kt
MESSAGE_PREFIX=BLE:

# BLE Service UUID used for GATT communication
SERVICE_UUID=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc

# BLE Characteristic UUID for read/write operations
CHARACTERISTIC_UUID=87654321-4321-4321-4321-cba987654321

# Apple Company ID used for manufacturer data in BLE advertisements
# Using Apple's ID (0x004C) for broader compatibility
APPLE_COMPANY_ID=0x004C

# Maximum message length constraints
# Total BLE advertisement payload is limited to ~31 bytes
# After accounting for service UUID, flags, and other overhead,
# we have approximately 15 bytes for the actual message
# With "BLE:" prefix (4 chars), users can send 11-character messages
MAX_TOTAL_MESSAGE_LENGTH=15

# Debug and logging settings
DEBUG_MODE=true
LOG_TIMESTAMPS=true
SHOW_RSSI_DETAILS=true

# Scanning and advertising settings
SCAN_MODE=LOW_LATENCY
ADVERTISE_MODE=LOW_LATENCY
TX_POWER_LEVEL=HIGH

# Connection settings
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS=10000

# Usage Examples:
# - With "BLE:" prefix: User can send 11 chars -> "BLE:Hello World" (15 total)
# - With "APP:" prefix: User can send 11 chars -> "APP:Hello World" (15 total)  
# - With "A:" prefix: User can send 13 chars -> "A:Hello Testing!" (15 total)
